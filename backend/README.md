# Backend Application

This directory contains the backend part of the application, which is built using Node.js and Express.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Server**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the server with the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on the default port (usually 3000). You can change the port in the `src/index.js` file if needed.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- **GET /api/example**: This is an example endpoint that returns a sample response.

## Folder Structure

- `src/index.js`: Entry point for the backend application, sets up the Express server and defines API routes.
- `package.json`: Contains the configuration for the backend, including dependencies and scripts.
