# Frontend Application

This directory contains the frontend part of the application built with React.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React application and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.jsx`: The main component of the application.
  - `index.jsx`: The entry point for the React application.
  
- `public/`: Contains static files.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file where the React app is mounted.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized build of the application in the `build` directory.
